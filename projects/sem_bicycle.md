# Beyond downtown: factors influencing utilitarian and recreational cycling in a low-income suburb

## Overview
This study examines factors influencing both utilitarian and recreational cycling in Scarborough, a low-income, auto-oriented suburb of Toronto. Despite many short trips suitable for cycling, utilitarian cycling remains low. The research explores how bicycle ownership, social connections, attitudes, and recreational cycling relate to utilitarian cycling, aiming to inform policies that increase cycling participation beyond downtown areas.

## Methods
Using survey data from 215 Scarborough residents, the study applied principal component analysis to identify attitudinal factors and used generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM) to analyze relationships between socio-demographics, attitudes, recreational cycling, and utilitarian cycling. The analysis focused on determining direct and indirect predictors of cycling behaviours in a suburban context with limited cycling infrastructure.

## Results
Findings showed that recreational cycling frequency strongly predicts utilitarian cycling, while the reverse was not significant. Bicycle ownership, knowing people who bike, and having access to repairs positively influenced both cycling types. Women were less likely to cycle for utilitarian purposes, and low car ownership was associated with higher utilitarian cycling. Attitudes influenced recreational but not utilitarian cycling. The results suggest interventions like group rides, bicycle access programs, and building social cycling networks can support suburban cycling uptake alongside infrastructure investments.
