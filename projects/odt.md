# Eliminating barriers to nighttime activity participation: the case of on-demand transit in Belleville, Canada

## Overview
This study investigates whether on-demand transit (ODT) services can reduce transportation barriers and improve nighttime activity participation in Belleville, Canada. It examines how user satisfaction with ODT influences their ability to engage in work, shopping, social, and recreational activities, particularly for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

## Methods
The authors conducted an online survey of ODT users in Belleville, collecting data on socio-demographics, travel behaviour, satisfaction with ODT, and changes in activity participation. Exploratory factor analysis identified four latent satisfaction factors (user interface, accessibility, reliability, and service quality). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was then used to examine relationships between these factors and activity participation changes.

## Results
Findings show that satisfaction with service reliability and quality is significantly associated with increased activity participation, while long wait times reduce participation. Users with longer in-vehicle times also reported greater increases in participation, possibly due to safer or more convenient longer-distance travel. Women showed higher increases in activity participation than men. Overall, ODT services enabled low-income and transport-poor residents to participate more fully in nighttime activities, suggesting potential for ODT to reduce social exclusion in low-demand contexts.
