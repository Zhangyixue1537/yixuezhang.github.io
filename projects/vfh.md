# The Transportation Impacts of Vehicle-for-Hire in the City of Toronto

## Overview
This report evaluates the impact of vehicle-for-hire (VFH) services—particularly private transportation companies (PTCs) like Uber and Lyft—on Toronto’s transportation system. The study focuses on key issues such as traffic congestion, transit competition, accessibility, and equity. It aims to inform policy decisions by examining how VFH services shape travel behaviour, road usage, and service quality.

## Methods
The analysis combines administrative data from PTCs and six major taxi brokerages, covering trip-level and vehicle-level operations. Supplementary insights were gathered from a citywide user survey and a transportation modeling study conducted in partnership with the University of Toronto. Key metrics analyzed include trip volumes, vehicle kilometres traveled (VKT), service availability, user satisfaction, and accessibility outcomes.

## Results
PTC trips have reached record levels in 2024, with 212,000 daily trips—7% above pre-pandemic highs. However, efficiency has declined, with more empty vehicle travel and fewer trips per vehicle. PTCs now account for 14% of daily traffic in the downtown core and 74% of all VFH travel distance citywide. While 34% of users use PTCs to connect to transit, 41–61% would switch to transit if PTCs were unavailable. User satisfaction is high, but service quality for wheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAVs) remains lower, with longer wait times and higher cancellation rates. Importantly, no major disparities were found between equity-deserving and other communities in terms of PTC service quality.
