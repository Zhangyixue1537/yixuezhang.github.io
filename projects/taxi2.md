# Travel behaviour differences among people with disabilities: A cluster analysis of accessible taxi users before and during the COVID-19 pandemic

## Overview
This study examines the travel behaviour of people with disabilities (PWD) using accessible taxi services in Toronto before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. It identifies who uses these services, how they use them, whether distinct user groups exist based on travel patterns, and how the pandemic impacted their mobility.

## Methods
Using operational data from Checker Taxi, the analysis covers nearly one million accessible taxi trips by 40,000 users between June 2018 and June 2021. K-means cluster analysis was conducted based on six variables related to travel frequency, diversity, timing, and trip purpose. Spatial analysis was used to infer usersâ€™ home locations and assess neighbourhood socio-demographics.

## Results
The study identified five distinct user profiles, including frequent users, weekday afternoon users, occasional users, weekday health users, and weekend users. During the pandemic, the number of users dropped significantly, especially among occasional and weekend users, while health-related trips increased. Users who continued or started using services during the pandemic were more likely to live in socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods, highlighting the critical role of accessible taxis in supporting marginalized communities.
