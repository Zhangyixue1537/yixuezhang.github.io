# Toronto's Transportation Equity Opportunity Zones (TEOZ)

## Overview
The Transportation Equity Opportunity Zones (TEOZ) initiative is a pilot project led by the City of Toronto to identify areas with high transportation equity needs and to inform targeted improvements. By applying a policy-driven framework grounded in distributive justice principles, TEOZ aims to ensure that historically underserved communities have equitable access to safe, affordable, and reliable transportation options. The pilot supports Torontoâ€™s broader commitment to making equity foundational to transportation decision-making.

## Methods
The TEOZ pilot combined spatial data analysis, equity-focused metrics, and community input. A Transportation Equity Index was developed to identify priority areas by mapping transportation barriers (e.g., affordability, accessibility, safety) against demographic vulnerabilities (e.g., income, race, disability, gender). The team used a structured demographic analysis framework to connect specific population groups to relevant transportation barriers, guiding project screening and strategy development. The pilot also incorporated lessons from community-based research and internal engagement with city divisions.

## Results
The TEOZ pilot identified 20 zones across Toronto where transportation inequities are most concentrated. These zones are now being used to guide internal City planning, investment prioritization, and coordination across departments. The pilot revealed that equity-related transportation barriers intersect with multiple social factors, and that successful interventions require tailored, place-based strategies. The initiative has also contributed to building a clearer policy and methodological foundation for equity analysis across future transportation projects in Toronto.
