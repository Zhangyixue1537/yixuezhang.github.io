# Exploring travel patterns of people with disabilities: A multilevel analysis of accessible taxi trips in Toronto, Canada

## Overview
This study explores how people with disabilities (PWD) use accessible taxi services in Toronto, Canada. It examines when and where these trips occur, their primary purposes, and factors affecting wait and in-vehicle times. The research addresses transport-related social exclusion (TRSE) and highlights the need for inclusive transportation planning.

## Methods
The analysis used operational data from Checker Taxi, covering over 800,000 accessible taxi trips between June 2018 and June 2021. Descriptive and spatial-temporal analyses identified trip patterns, while multilevel regression models assessed how trip-level variables (purpose, timing, COVID-19 period) and neighbourhood-level factors (population density, income, health service density) influence wait and in-vehicle times.

## Results
Findings show that over 30% of trips were for health-related services, mainly clustered in downtown and midtown areas with major hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced ridership but increased the proportion of health-related trips. Multilevel regression results revealed that both trip and neighbourhood characteristics affect travel times; for example, low-income neighbourhoods experienced longer wait and in-vehicle times, highlighting spatial and social inequities in accessible taxi services.
